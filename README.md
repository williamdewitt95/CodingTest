Note: These programs were compiled with: (OpenJDK-8) and assume that this compiler will be used if possible.
Problems 1 and 2 require GNode.java for testing purposes ( though not for the walkGraph() and paths() functions themselves )
Problem 3 requires data.txt for testing purpose ( though the function could be run on a different file )

Each problem is independently run.
